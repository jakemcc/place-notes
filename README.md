# Place Notes

A minimal progressive web app that lets you create notes associated with your current location. It is installable and works offline.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Click "Get location" to capture your coordinates, then add notes with the form. Notes are stored in IndexedDB and persist across reloads.
