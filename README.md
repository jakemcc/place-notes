# Place Notes

A minimal progressive web app that lets you create notes associated with your current location. It is installable and works offline.

## Development

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Click "Get location" to capture your coordinates, then add notes with the form. Notes are stored in IndexedDB and persist across reloads.

Location is only retrieved when you press the button and is not tracked continuously.
